These are options of VLC --> auto detect - locate :
Path: executionLocation\Database\vlcLocation.txt



*By default we will look for your VLC in the default path (C:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC)

if VLC is not there, program will ask you to manually specify the installation folder location of VLC
*Be careful to enter the folder path, not the program itself
