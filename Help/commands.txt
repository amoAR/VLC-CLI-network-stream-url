Pcommands.txt is used for playlists



--play-and-exit
	Play and exit (enabled)
    Exit if there are no more items in the playlist.

--qt-continue=2
	Continue playback? {0 (Never), 1 (Ask), 2 (Always)}
	
--no-stats
	Locally collect statistics (disabled)
	
--clock-synchro=0
	Clock synchronisation {-1 (Default), 0 (Disable), 1 (Enable)} 
	It is possible to disable the input clock synchronisation for real-time sources. Use this if you experience jerky playback of network streams.
	
--role=video
	Media role {video,music,communication,game,notification,animation,production,accessibility}
	Media (player) role for operating system policy.

--preferred-resolution=-1
	Preferred video resolution {-1 (Best available), 1080 (Full HD (1080p)), 720 (HD (720p)), 576 (Standard Definition (576 or 480 lines)), 360 (Low Definition (360 lines)), 240 (Very Low Definition (240 lines))}
    When several video formats are available, select one whose resolution is closest to (but not higher than) this setting, in number of lines. Use this option if you don't have enough CPU power or network bandwidth to play higher resolutions.

--fps-fps=144
	Frame rate
	FPS conversion video filter

--sout-transcode-fps=144
	Video frame-rate
    Target output frame rate for the video stream.

	Show media title on video (disabled)	

--qt-name-in-title
	Show playing item name in window title (enabled)

--swscale-mode=8
	Scaling mode {0 (Fast bilinear), 1 (Bilinear), 2 (Bicubic (good quality)), 3 (Experimental), 4 (Nearest neighbour (bad quality)), 5 (Area), 6 (Luma bicubic / chroma bilinear), 7 (Gauss), 8 (SincR), 9 (Lanczos), 10 (Bicubic spline)}
	Video scaling filter (swscale)

--directx-3buffering
	Use triple buffering for overlays (enabled)

--direct3d11-hw-blending
	Use hardware blending support (enabled)
    Try to use hardware acceleration for subtitle/OSD blending.

--avcodec-hw=d3d11va
	Hardware decoding {any,d3d11va,dxva2,none}
    This allows hardware decoding when available.

--avcodec-skiploopfilter=4
	Skip the loop filter for H.264 decoding {0 (None), 1 (Non-ref), 2 (Bidir), 3 (Non-key), 4 (All)}
    Skipping the loop filter (aka deblocking) usually has a detrimental effect on quality. However it provides a big speedup for high definition streams.

--postproc-q=6
	Post processing quality <[0 .. 6]>
    Quality of post processing. Valid range is 0 (disabled) to 6 (highest) Higher levels require more CPU power, but produce higher quality pictures.

--sout-mp4-faststart
	Create "Fast Start" files (enabled)
    Create "Fast Start" files. "Fast Start" files are optimized for downloads and allow the user to start previewing the file while it is downloading.

--sout-deinterlace-phosphor-chroma=4
	Phosphor chroma mode for 4:2:0 input {1 (Latest), 2 (AltLine), 3 (Blend), 4 (Upconvert)}
    Choose handling for colours in those output frames that fall across input frame boundaries.
	Latest: take chroma from new (bright) field only. Good for interlaced input, such as videos from a camcorder.  
    AltLine: take chroma line 1 from top field, line 2 from bottom field, etc.  Default, good for NTSC telecined input (anime DVDs, etc.).  
    Blend: average input field chromas. May distort the colours of the new (bright) field, too.
	Upconvert: output in 4:2:2 format (independent chroma for each field). Best simulation, but requires more CPU and memory bandwidth.

--sout-x264-preset=ultrafast
	Default preset setting used {ultrafast,superfast,veryfast,faster,fast,medium,slow,slower,veryslow,placebo}

--sout-x264-tune=film
	Default tune setting used {film,animation,grain,stillimage,psnr,ssim,fastdecode,zerolatency}

--sout-x264-level=51
	H.264 level
	Specify H.264 level (as defined by Annex A of the standard). Levels are not enforced; it's up to the user to select a level compatible with the rest of the encoding options.
	Range 1 to 5.1 (10 to 51 is also allowed). Set to 0 for letting x264 set level.

--sout-x264-profile=high444
	H.264 profile {baseline,main,high,high10,high422,high444}
	Specify H.264 profile which limits are enforced over other settings

--sout-x264-bluray-compat
	Enable compatibility hacks for Blu-ray support (enabled)
    Enable hacks for Blu-ray support, this doesn't enforce every aspect

--antiflicker-softening-size=31
	Softening value <[0 .. 31]>
	Number of frames consider for smoothening (0 to 30)

--src-converter-type=0
	Sample rate converter type {0 (Sinc function (best quality)), 1 (Sinc function (medium quality)), 2 (Sinc function (fast)), 3 (Zero Order Hold (fastest)), 4 (Linear (fastest))}
    Different resampling algorithms are supported. The best one is slower, while the fast one exhibits low quality.

--network-caching=333
	Network caching (ms) <[0 .. 60000]>
    Caching value for network resources, in milliseconds.

--mtu=1492
	MTU of the network interface
    This is the maximum application-layer packet size that can be transmitted over the network (in bytes).

--aout=directsound
	Audio output module {any,mmdevice,directsound,waveout,amem,afile,adummy,none}
    This is the audio output method used by VLC. The default behavior is to automatically select the best method available.

--directx-volume=0.8
	Audio volume <[0.000000 .. 2.000000]>
    Audio volume in hundredths of decibels (dB)

--qt-max-volume=200
	Maximum Volume displayed <[60 .. 300]> 

--no-audio-time-stretch

    This allows playing audio at lower or higher speed without affecting the audio pitch

--force-dolby-surround=1
	Force detection of Dolby Surround {0 (Auto), 1 (On), 2 (Off)} 
    Use this when you know your stream is (or is not) encoded with Dolby Surround but fails to be detected as such. Even if the stream is not actually encoded with Dolby Surround, turning on this option might enhance your experience, especially when combined with the Headphone Channel Mixer.

--stereo-mode=5
