These are options of subtitle --> locate - skip - reset - auto detect :
Path: executionLocation\Database\subLocation.txt



*For the first time running the program, it will ask to specify the path to automatically find the subtitles

1
    Set subtitle folder location path

2
    skip this setting
    This will cancel the automatic subtitle search for videos



*If you request a change for this setting (like give path, change previous path or skip), you can change it next time

reset sub, 0
    Reset subtitle setting
    Again, the program will ask you to provide the path of your subtitles or skip



How auto detect subtitle works?

1- if you enter valid URL --> http(s)://netflix.com/the_name_S01E01_quality_BluRay.mkv
2- it convert to -----------> S01E01
3- search in the folder you specified
4- if the search is successful, the subtitle file path will be added to the command.txt file

*The last 10 search results can be seen in executionLocation\Database\subFinder.log
